# TriStateToggle Debugging Report
**Date:** October 29, 2025

**Issue:** TriStateToggle buttons incorrectly trigger completion logic

## Executive Summary

Testing revealed a critical issue where the TriStateToggle buttons for overdue tasks incorrectly trigger the `completeOverdueTask` function regardless of which status button is clicked, instead of properly cycling through task states (Pending → In Progress → Done).

## Test Setup

- **Navigation**: Successfully navigated to Oct 29, 2025 (today)
- **Environment**: Debugging version with console logging enabled
- **Test Tasks Created**: 
  1. "Test TriState Toggle Task"
  2. "Second TriState Toggle Test"

## TriStateToggle Button Configuration

Each overdue task displays three status buttons:
- **Pending** (represented by empty circle or grey icon)
- **In Progress** (represented by orange/active state)
- **Done** (represented by green checkmark)

## Critical Issue Identified

### Problem Description
When clicking the "Pending" button on "Test TriState Toggle Task", the application incorrectly triggered the completion logic instead of setting the task to "Pending" status.

### Console Evidence
The following console logs were captured immediately after clicking the "Pending" button:

```
Task status changing: [object Object]
Calling onCompleteTask callback
completeOverdueTask called: [object Object]
Found overdue task: [object Object]
Updated current record: done
Saving updated current record
Refetch triggered
```

### Expected vs Actual Behavior
- **Expected**: Clicking "Pending" should set task status to "Pending"
- **Actual**: Clicking "Pending" immediately set task status to "Done" and triggered completion logic

## Test Results

### Test 1: First Task - "Test TriState Toggle Task"
- **Initial State**: In Progress (orange highlight)
- **Action**: Clicked "Pending" button (element [23])
- **Result**: Status changed to "Done" with completion logic triggered
- **Evidence**: Console logs showing `completeOverdueTask` function called

### Test 2: Button Responsiveness
- **"Done" Button**: No additional console logs (task already completed)
- **"In Progress" Button**: No additional console logs (no action triggered)
- **"Pending" Button**: Triggered incorrect completion logic

## Visual Evidence

Screenshots captured during testing:
1. `initial_page_load.png` - Initial application state
2. `after_add_overdue_task_click.png` - Task creation form
3. `after_adding_overdue_task.png` - First task created
4. `after_scroll_down.png` - TriStateToggle buttons visible
5. `after_clicking_pending_button.png` - State after clicking Pending
6. `both_tasks_with_tristate_toggles.png` - Both tasks visible
7. `final_testing_state.png` - Final state documentation

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause
The TriStateToggle component appears to have incorrect event handling logic where:
1. All three status buttons trigger the same completion callback
2. The status state management is not properly distinguishing between different button clicks
3. The completion logic is being called regardless of intended target state

### Impact
- Users cannot set tasks to "Pending" or "In Progress" states properly
- Tasks jump directly to "Done" status when any button is clicked
- This breaks the intended tri-state workflow for task management

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Event Handlers**: Review the TriStateToggle component's click event handlers to ensure each button correctly sets its intended state
2. **State Management**: Verify that the state management logic properly handles transitions between Pending → In Progress → Done
3. **Callback Functions**: Ensure completion callbacks are only triggered when the "Done" button is clicked
4. **Testing**: Implement automated tests for each TriStateToggle button to prevent regression

## Environment Details

- **Browser Console**: Enabled and monitored throughout testing
- **Service Worker**: Successfully registered (normal operation)
- **Date Navigation**: October 29, 2025 (today) confirmed
- **Application State**: Daily Progress Tracker with goals, priorities, and overdue tasks functionality

## Conclusion

The TriStateToggle issue is confirmed and reproducible. The primary problem is that clicking any status button incorrectly triggers the completion logic, preventing proper state management of overdue tasks. This significantly impacts the usability of the task management system.
